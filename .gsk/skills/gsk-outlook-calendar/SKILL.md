# gsk-outlook-calendar

**PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gsk-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules.

> **Note:** a unified `gsk connector` flow is rolling out (see `../gsk-connector/SKILL.md`: `gsk connector tools <id>` / `gsk connector call <id> -t <tool>`) and may not be enabled for every account yet. THIS command remains fully supported — use it directly, and it stays the fallback whenever `gsk connector` is unavailable.

Outlook Calendar operations. Actions: list, free_busy, create, respond, modify, delete.

## Usage

```bash
gsk outlook_calendar [options]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `<action>` (positional) | Yes | Action to perform. 'list': List upcoming calendar events. Returns at most 'limit' (default 20) events; the response sets truncated=true when more events exist in the window; 'free_busy': Query free/busy availability for people (any org member) in a time window (find open meeting slots); 'create': Create a new calendar event. By default this returns a LOCAL DRAFT only — nothing lands in the calendar until the user confirms it in the Genspark UI. Callers without a confirmation UI (e.g. gsk) must pass --skip_confirmation to create the event directly; 'respond': RSVP (accept / decline / tentative) to an existing invite. Supports --comment and --proposed_new_time (Outlook-only counter-proposal); 'modify': Modify (Graph PATCH /me/events/{id}) an existing event in place without delete+create; 'delete': Delete a calendar event (string, one of: list, free_busy, create, respond, modify, delete) |

| `--location` | No | [create] The location of the event \| [modify] New event location. (string) |
| `--description` | No | [create] Description or details of the event.

| `--scope` | No | [respond] Recurring-series scope. 'single' (default) responds for the specific occurrence only; 'series' resolves the seriesMasterId and responds for the entire series. \| [modify] Recurring-series scope.

## Write Confirmation (double-call)

Write actions (send / create / update / delete / react / upload, and write methods through `api` where present) may be confirmation-gated. A response carrying `status: "pending_confirmation"` (or a similar needs-confirmation payload) is NOT a failure — it executes nothing and summarizes what would happen. To complete the write, re-run the IDENTICAL command: the pending record (15-minute TTL) is matched and the operation executes; success clears the record (a further identical call pends again) and a failed execution keeps it, so the retry arc stays open. Where the Flags table lists `--skip_confirmation` for an action, passing `--skip_confirmation true` right after a pending response is honored; gated actions without that flag complete ONLY via the double-call.
