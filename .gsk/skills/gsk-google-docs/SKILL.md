# gsk-google-docs

**PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gsk-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules.

> **Note:** a unified `gsk connector` flow is rolling out (see `../gsk-connector/SKILL.md`: `gsk connector tools <id>` / `gsk connector call <id> -t <tool>`) and may not be enabled for every account yet. THIS command remains fully supported — use it directly, and it stays the fallback whenever `gsk connector` is unavailable.

Google Docs document operations. Actions: create, read, append, batch_update, export, search.

## Usage

```bash
gsk docs [options]
```

**Aliases:** `docs`

| `--title` | No | [create] Title of the new document. (string) |
| `--content` | No | [create] Optional initial text content for the document. \| [append] The text content to append to the document. (string) |

## Write Confirmation (double-call)

Write actions (send / create / update / delete / react / upload, and write methods through `api` where present) may be confirmation-gated. A response carrying `status: "pending_confirmation"` (or a similar needs-confirmation payload) is NOT a failure — it executes nothing and summarizes what would happen. To complete the write, re-run the IDENTICAL command: the pending record (15-minute TTL) is matched and the operation executes; success clears the record (a further identical call pends again) and a failed execution keeps it, so the retry arc stays open. Where the Flags table lists `--skip_confirmation` for an action, passing `--skip_confirmation true` right after a pending response is honored; gated actions without that flag complete ONLY via the double-call.
