# gsk-slack

**PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gsk-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules.

> **Note:** a unified `gsk connector` flow is rolling out (see `../gsk-connector/SKILL.md`: `gsk connector tools <id>` / `gsk connector call <id> -t <tool>`) and may not be enabled for every account yet. THIS command remains fully supported — use it directly, and it stays the fallback whenever `gsk connector` is unavailable.

Slack messaging operations. Actions: send, search, read, lookup, react, upload, update, delete, permalink, connect_invites, connect_approve, connect_decline.

## Usage

```bash
gsk slack [options]
```

| `--message` | No | [send] The message content to send. Supports Slack markdown formatting. To @mention someone, embed '<@USER_ID>' (e.g. '<@U01234567>') in the text — a plain '@Name' renders as literal text and notifies nobody. User IDs come from the lookup action.

## Write Confirmation (double-call)

Write actions (send / create / update / delete / react / upload, and write methods through `api` where present) may be confirmation-gated. A response carrying `status: "pending_confirmation"` (or a similar needs-confirmation payload) is NOT a failure — it executes nothing and summarizes what would happen. To complete the write, re-run the IDENTICAL command: the pending record (15-minute TTL) is matched and the operation executes; success clears the record (a further identical call pends again) and a failed execution keeps it, so the retry arc stays open. Where the Flags table lists `--skip_confirmation` for an action, passing `--skip_confirmation true` right after a pending response is honored; gated actions without that flag complete ONLY via the double-call.
