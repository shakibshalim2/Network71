# gsk-google-calendar

**PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gsk-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules.

> **Note:** a unified `gsk connector` flow is rolling out (see `../gsk-connector/SKILL.md`: `gsk connector tools <id>` / `gsk connector call <id> -t <tool>`) and may not be enabled for every account yet. THIS command remains fully supported — use it directly, and it stays the fallback whenever `gsk connector` is unavailable.

Google Calendar operations. Actions: list, free_busy, create, respond, modify, delete.

## Usage

```bash
gsk google_calendar [options]
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `<action>` (positional) | Yes | Action to perform. 'list': List upcoming calendar events. Returns at most 'limit' (default 20) events; the response sets truncated=true when more events exist in the window; 'free_busy': Query free/busy intervals for calendars in a time window (find open meeting slots); 'create': Create a new calendar event. By default this returns a LOCAL DRAFT only — nothing lands in the calendar until the user confirms it in the Genspark UI. Callers without a confirmation UI (e.g. gsk) must pass --skip_confirmation to create the event directly; 'respond': RSVP (accept / decline / tentative) to an existing invite so the organizer's UI reflects the response; 'modify': Modify (events.patch) an existing event in place without delete+create; 'delete': Delete a calendar event (string, one of: list, free_busy, create, respond, modify, delete) |
| `--filter_query` | No | [list] Text to filter calendar events, empty for listing all events (string) |

Pass with --end_time when rescheduling. (string) |
| `--end_time` | No | [free_busy] Window end, RFC3339. \| [create] End time of the event in ISO 8601 format, must include correct timezone offset (e.g., 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss-hh:mm') \| [modify] New end time (ISO 8601 with timezone offset). Required if start_time is given. (string) |

Supports restricted HTML formatting (safe subset rendered via Vue v-html): <a>, <b>, <strong>, <i>, <em>, <u>, <br>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <span>, <img>. Use for links, bold, italics, lists, line breaks, images. \| [modify] New event description (optional). Supports the same restricted HTML subset as create. (string) |

| `--calendar_id` | No | [create] The calendar identifier. Use 'primary' for the user's primary calendar or provide a specific calendar email address (string) |
| `--event_id` | No | [create] The event identifier. If the request is to modify an existing event, provide the event_id of the event to be modified. If the request is to create a new event, leave this field empty. \| [respond] Google Calendar event id of the invitation to respond to. For a recurring-series instance, the id has shape '<seriesId>_<startTs>'. \| [modify] Google Calendar event id to modify. For a recurring-series instance, the id has shape '<seriesId>_<startTs>'. \| [delete] The Google Calendar event ID to delete (string) |
| `--recurrence` | No | [create] Recurrence rules (e.g., ['RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;COUNT=2']) \| [modify] New recurrence rules (e.g. ['RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO']). Only honored when scope=series. (array) |

| `--skip_confirmation` | No | [create] If true, create the event directly in Google Calendar instead of returning a local draft. Required when the caller has no UI to review/confirm a draft (e.g. sandbox agents shelling out via gsk). (boolean, default: `False`) |
| `--auto_skip_confirmation` | No | [create] Set to true ONLY if the workflow step has [AUTO_SKIP_CONFIRMATION] marker. This indicates the node is configured to always skip confirmation. (boolean, default: `False`) |

| `--add_attendees` | No | [modify] Append these attendees to the existing list. Combine with remove_attendees for an additive edit; both leave attendees the caller didn't name alone. (array) |
| `--remove_attendees` | No | [modify] Remove these attendees from the existing list (case-insensitive email match). (array) |
| `--delete_series` | No | [delete] If true and the event is recurring, delete the entire series. If false, only delete the single instance. Default is false. (boolean, default: `False`) |

## Write Confirmation (double-call)

Write actions (send / create / update / delete / react / upload, and write methods through `api` where present) may be confirmation-gated. A response carrying `status: "pending_confirmation"` (or a similar needs-confirmation payload) is NOT a failure — it executes nothing and summarizes what would happen. To complete the write, re-run the IDENTICAL command: the pending record (15-minute TTL) is matched and the operation executes; success clears the record (a further identical call pends again) and a failed execution keeps it, so the retry arc stays open. Where the Flags table lists `--skip_confirmation` for an action, passing `--skip_confirmation true` right after a pending response is honored; gated actions without that flag complete ONLY via the double-call.
